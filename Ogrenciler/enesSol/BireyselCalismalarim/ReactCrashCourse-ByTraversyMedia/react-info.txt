React is a library for building user interfaces which runs on the client as a SPA (Single Page Application).
And can be used to build full stack apps by communicating with a server/API (such as MERN).

PROS of Using React
Structures the "view" layer of your apps
Reuseable components with their own state
JSX
Interactive UIs with Virtual DOM

Components 
Components render/return JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension)
Components can also take in "props" : <Header title="My Title" />
Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves.
"App" or "global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI.

React Hooks
React Hooks are functions that let us hook into the React state and lifecycle features from function components.

useState - Returns a stateful value and function to update it.
useEffect - Perform side effects in function components.
